# <Site-Refactoring>

## Description

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide: -->

I was eager to overcome this challenge in which I was requested to refactor and fix broken code strands within the HTML and CSS files provided.
This project was built to showcase my skills in refactoring, identifying invalid lines of code while replacing non-semantic &lt;div&gt; tags with semantic html5 tags.
My project ultimately educates any like-minded peers on how to refactor, implement semantic tags, and to enhance any site's ranking with satisfied accessibility standards on common search engines.
I was able to learn how to be more efficient with setting up style sheets to be organized to prevent headaches in the future when I may return to borrow or polish my skills.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
